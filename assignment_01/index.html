            <h2>1. Flatness</h2>
    
            <!-- <p>First paragraph goes here. All of a sudden <span class="clickable">the object began to move strangely</span>.</p> -->
            <p>In the dimly lit cave, flickering flames cast dancing shadows upon the rough walls, mesmerizing the cave dwellers with their ever-changing shapes. Among them, the most captivating is the shadow of what appears to be a towering ice cream cone. As the scene progresses, the cone shadow <span class="clickable" id="first-change">begins to sway gently</span> as if caught in an unseen breeze. To the cave people, it seems as though the icy treat is swaying recklessly, defying gravity and threatening to topple over the edge of the cave wall into the abyss below. Some whisper tales of spirits playing tricks, while others speculate about the mysterious forces at play in their world. As they watch, mesmerized yet cautious, the cone shadow suddenly starts to act weird, its form gradually transforming into that of a <span class="clickable" id="second-change">whimsical clown hat</span>. The once-stable cone now seems to swing back and forth, taking on the shape of a clown hat that swings and oscillate with almost mischievous energy. The cave people exchange nervous glances, unsure what to make of this bizarre transformation. Is it a sign from the gods, an omen of good or ill? Or perhaps just another enigma of their shadowy world, where mysteries hide around every corner, waiting to be explained.</p>

            <p>Nick Sousanis's concept of Flatness refers to a mindset or perspective that sees the world in simplistic, two-dimensional terms, lacking depth or complexity. Fundamentally, it's a way of perceiving reality that fails to recognize the nuances and layers that exist within it. To the cave people, their interpretation of the shifting ice cream cone and clown hat shadows embodies this concept of Flatness. They view these phenomena solely through the lens of superstition and immediate sensory experience, failing to delve deeper into the underlying causes or potential symbolism. Rather than questioning the nature of the shadows or seeking to understand the scientific principles behind them, they attribute them to supernatural spirits. Their worldview is flat in the sense that it lacks the depth of understanding and critical thinking necessary to grasp the true nature of the world around them. They see only the surface, unable or unwilling to explore the underlying complexities. For example, in their limited understanding, the cave people may perceive the clown hat shadow as <span class="clickable" id="third-change">an inverted version of the ice cream</span> and continue to see the world in simple terms and superficially. They don't think about light and objects like we do and accept what they see without questioning it.</p>

            <h2>2. Seeing Double</h2>

            <p>In the Three.js scene outside the cave, a virtual sun illuminates a 3D clown hat and an ice cream cone model positioned on the digital terrain. These objects serve as focal points for the creation of shadows on the cave wall, influenced by the simulated sunlight. As the scene unfolds, a subtle change occurs— <span class="clickable" id="fourth-change">clown hat begins to sway gently</span> from right to left while the ice cream cone remains still. This movement, distinct from the stationary ice cream cone, creates an illusion for those inside the cave. To them, it may seem that only the clown hat is moving horizontally, reinforcing their initial interpretation of the shadow. However, as the scene progresses further, another change takes place—the virtual sun begins to shift its position from right to left, <span class="clickable" id="fifth-change">casting dynamic shadows</span> that mimic the movement of both the clown hat and the ice cream cone. This transformation alters the appearance of the shadows on the cave wall, creating the impression that both objects are in motion. From the outside perspective, viewers witness the evolving interplay between the virtual objects and the shifting virtual light source, offering insights into the complex nature of perception. This view underscores the importance of considering multiple perspectives to comprehend the true nature of the scene.</p>

            <p>Nick Sousanis's concept of Seeing Double becomes relevant in understanding these shifting shadows. It emphasizes the importance of considering multiple perspectives to gain a deeper understanding of a situation. Seeing Double, to me, means the ability to perceive multiple perspectives simultaneously. It involves understanding that there are often multiple layers of meaning and interpretation to any given situation or concept. Rather than viewing things in a simplistic, black-and-white manner, Seeing Double encourages us to consider the nuances and complexities inherent in our experiences. From the viewpoint outside the cave, observers witness the intricate interplay between the 3D objects and the dynamic light source, realizing how their movements contribute to the changing shadows on the cave wall. Conversely, those within the cave perceive only the shadows, interpreting them based on their limited perspective. By combining both views, we can grasp the scene's full complexity—how the objects' movements and the shifting sunlight interact to create the illusions perceived by the cave people. This reveals a fundamental truth: our understanding of reality is shaped by what we see and how we interpret it. Seeing Double prompts us to consider multiple viewpoints, recognizing that each offers valuable insights into the complexities of perception and interpretation. Ultimately, it emphasizes the importance of embracing diverse perspectives to attain a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the world around us.</p>
